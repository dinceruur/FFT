# FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Android Acceleration Data
This app reads sensor data until reaches the desired sample size, and than transforms this data with Fast Fourier.
FFT part is implemented as native code : for more info take a look at <a href="https://github.com/berndporr/kiss-fft">this repo</a>.

# Important Notes
<ul>
  <li>You can set sampling size on config screen like 512,1024, ... </li>
  <li>This app just exports raw Acceleration Data not fft data.</li>
</ul>
